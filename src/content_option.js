    "Hello there! I'm a computer science master's student at New York University, with a background in mechanical engineering and robotics from Northeastern University. ",
  aboutme2:
    "I'm passionate about artificial intelligence and have gained practical experience through my internship at Plantec, where I focused on data analysis and machine learning models for market forecasting. I've also applied my skills to diverse projects, such as developing a lane detection algorithm for self-driving cars, creating a Java-based 2D adventure game, and building a Python-based stock trend analysis tool. I have also ventured into iOS development, creating a StockNotes app to assist traders. My technical proficiencies include programming languages like C++, Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Swift, and Java. ",
  aboutme3:
    "\n\n As I forge ahead in my career, I’m excited to explore new opportunities where I can leverage my skills to bring value, while continuing to learn and grow in the dynamic field of technology. I'm also interested in collaborating with others on projects that can make a positive impact on the world. Feel free to reach out to me if you're interested in discussing any potential collaborations, or if you simply want to connect. ",
